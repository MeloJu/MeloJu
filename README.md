## 📌 Highlight Project

### ⚽ AI Football Scout – Dynamic Player × Team Matching

An AI-driven scouting system that:

* Transforms football statistics into **vector representations**
* Clusters players by **playstyle**
* Represents teams as **aggregated player vectors**
* Uses **cosine similarity** to rank player–team compatibility

🔍 Result: the model independently highlighted **Jude Bellingham** as a top match for **Real Madrid** using 2022–23 data — aligned with the real-world transfer.

Technologies:

* Python, Pandas, scikit-learn
* K-Means, PCA, Cosine Similarity
* ETL + Data Lake architecture
